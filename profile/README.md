BazaarTrade is a cryptocurrency exchange platform built with a microservices architecture in Go. Itâ€™s designed to simulate the structure and behavior of a real trading system, focusing on the core elements of order matching, real-time market data, and user authentication. The system is modular and scalable, with separate services handling order books, quotes, user authentication, and routing. This design allows for clear separation of concerns and easy expansion or modification of individual components.
